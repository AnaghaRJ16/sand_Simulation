# Sand Simulation

## Overview

This project is a sand simulation that visually demonstrates the behavior of sand particles in a controlled environment. Users can interact with the simulation by adding particles, observing their movement, and manipulating various parameters to see how they affect the simulation.

## Features

- **Interactive Particle Addition**: Users can click and drag to add sand particles to the simulation area.
- **Gravity Effect**: Particles fall under the influence of gravity, mimicking real-world sand behavior.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust settings such as particle size, color, and simulation speed.

## Technologies Used

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library for creative coding.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.

## Getting Started

To run the sand simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnaghaRJ16/sand_Simulation.git
   cd sand_Simulation
